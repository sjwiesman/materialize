//! Command implementations for the mz-deploy CLI.
//!
//! Each subcommand lives in its own module and exposes a `run()` entry point
//! that returns `Result<T, CliError>`. The [`executor`](super::executor) module
//! dispatches to these functions after setting up configuration and connections.
//!
//! ## Commands
//!
//! - **[`new_project`]** — Scaffold a new mz-deploy project directory.
//! - **[`compile`]** — Parse and validate the project, optionally type-checking
//!   against a Docker container.
//! - **[`explain`]** — Show the EXPLAIN plan for a materialized view or index.
//! - **[`stage`]** — Deploy the project to a staging or preview environment.
//!   Preview deployments are a non-promotable variant exposed by this same
//!   command.
//! - **[`wait`]** — Check hydration status of a staged deployment.
//! - **[`promote`]** — Promote a staged deployment to production.
//! - **[`apply_all`]** — Orchestrate all infrastructure apply steps.
//! - **[`abort`]** — Roll back a staged deployment.
//! - **[`apply_sources`]** — Create sources that don't exist.
//! - **[`apply_tables`]** — Create tables that don't exist.
//! - **[`lock`]** — Generate or refresh the `types.lock` file from
//!   the live region.
//! - **[`describe`]** — Print a summary of the compiled project.
//! - **[`debug`]** — Dump internal state for troubleshooting.
//! - **[`list`]** — List active deployments.
//! - **[`setup`]** — Initialize deployment tracking infrastructure.
//! - **[`log`]** — Show deployment history.
//! - **[`clusters`]** — List or inspect cluster definitions.
//! - **[`roles`]** — List or inspect role definitions.
//! - **[`apply_network_policies`]** — Apply network policy definitions.
//! - **`test`** — Run SQL unit tests against cached type information.
//!
//! ## Shared Types
//!
//! - [`ObjectRef`] — A `(ObjectId, &DatabaseObject)` pair used as the canonical
//!   unit of work when iterating over objects in dependency order.

use crate::project;

/// Fully-qualified object identity paired with its typed SQL representation.
///
/// Used across command modules as the canonical unit of work when iterating
/// over objects in dependency order.
